The thing that I am most proud of is the modeling of
Hogwarts. I put a lot of time into the research
and into making it be as close to realistic
as possible, with the exception of a couple
windows. I also really like the work I did with
the skybox and the fact that I was able to make
the skybox "glow" as the sun rose and "dim" as
the sun set.
